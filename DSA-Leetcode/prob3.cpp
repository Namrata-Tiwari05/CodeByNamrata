// üß† Problem Explanation (LeetCode 440 - K-th Smallest in Lexicographical Order)
// Prompt:
// You are given two integers n and k. You need to return the k-th lexicographically smallest integer in the range [1, n].
// The lexicographical order is similar to dictionary order, where numbers are compared digit by digit.
// For example, for n = 13, the lexicographical order of numbers is: 1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 2, 3, ..., 9.
// üîß Step-by-Step Approach
// üîπ Step 1: Start at prefix 1 (which is the first number in lexicographical order)
// üîπ Step 2: At every step:
// Count how many numbers exist starting with current prefix (we call it step)

// If k > step:

// That means our answer is not in this subtree

// Move to next sibling (i.e., curr = curr + 1)

// Subtract step from k

// If k ‚â§ step:

// That means our answer is inside this subtree

// Move to child (i.e., curr = curr * 10)

// Decrease k by 1 (because we‚Äôre counting this move)

// Repeat this until k == 0.

// üîπ Step 3: Return curr as the k-th number
// ‚è±Ô∏è Time Complexity
// We only go as deep as the height of the tree, which is log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ(n), and in the worst case, we do this for about log n levels.

// So time complexity is approximately O(log n * log n)
