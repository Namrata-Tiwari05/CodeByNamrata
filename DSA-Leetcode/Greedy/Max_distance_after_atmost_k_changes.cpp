//  Problem Name:
// Maximum Distance After At Most k Changes

// ðŸ“Œ Problem Description (Inferred):
// You are given a string s consisting of directions: 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W'.
// Each character represents a movement in a 2D plane from the origin.
// You are allowed to change at most k characters in the string to maximize the final Manhattan distance from the origin.

// Return the maximum possible Manhattan distance from the origin after at most k changes.

// ðŸ§  Logic & Explanation:
// ðŸ”¹ Step-by-step:
// We simulate the traversal along the string s.

// Maintain counters for each direction:

// north, south, east, west

// For every character traversed:

// Update the appropriate direction count.

// Try to modify up to k characters to maximize distance.

// You can modify an N to S, or E to W (or vice versa) to stretch distance.

// For each step, compute the best modification possible using up to k operations and track the maximum Manhattan distance.

// ðŸ”¸ Modification Strategy:
// You want to increase the net distance between N-S and E-W.

// So, you're allowed to:

// Use up to k changes to amplify either of the two directions.

// Example: If N = 3 and S = 2, using one change on S â†’ N makes it N = 4, S = 1 â†’ |4 - 1| = 3.

// ðŸ”¹ Function: count(drt1, drt2, times)
// Calculates:
// abs(drt1 - drt2) + times * 2
// â†’ the abs() gives current distance
// â†’ times * 2 accounts for turning a move from one direction to its opposite, effectively stretching the distance by 2 per change.
